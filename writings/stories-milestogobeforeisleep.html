        <p class="article-writing"> I still remember the early days of my life. when life was full of tangerine and bittersweet moments.
When there were no chemistry, no physics, only a bit of math in life. That also had to count how
many chocolates I had. In those days I had no other motive in life other than going to my
grandparent&#39;s home after the year end exams. But standing on the verge of the highest peak of the
world. I felt as if I had taken the best decision in my entire life to leave university and persuing to
become a full time traveller. Since the first country I travelled outside my homeland. India.
I haven&#39;t ever regretted my decision even a bit.
When I first went to the waterfalls of Cherapunji in Meghalaya, when the waves getting splashed
from the stones hitting my body. I could feel the warmth inside the cold of the water. I wasn&#39;t quite
sure of my feelings about that particular part of my life. I could do nothing but stand in Silence,
stranded, froze Not in shock, but in wonder of creation. those tiny splashes from the waterfalls
made me realize how significant it is for us to travel, to know the unknown. From that very day till
today, I have visited 35 countries in total. And every single one of them changed my perception of
life from the lively and chaotic streets of LA, to the quiet and calm walks over the beaches of
Indonesia. I have been there through it all.
When I first stepped barefooted in the quite beaches of Bali, I felt the greatness of the sea, but the
feeling of how small I am compared to the waves was far more amazing. The sea taught me to stand
with loneliness. but be there for others when they&#39;re feeling low. When I first went to the mountain
ranges of Switzerland, the cold breeze from south went through my bones, taking everything Away
from my soul. I felt empty like never before, but I learned that sometimes you have to stand alone
against all odds. There were times when nothing felt right, when everything was against. And I still
remember weeping throughout the night, alone and broken inside. There were none to whom I
could share it all. I felt like going back to the sea, tell it how I felt, On, how badly I wished I could! In
the middle of my age I once went to Istanbul. It was always one of my dreams to visit this place,
since early teens. The amount of heritage and culture this city carries is surreal. But the most ecstatic
part was the hospitality of the people, it set a new epitome in my mind. After all this, now, here I
am, at the basecamp of Mount Everest in Nepal. Probably the very last stop of my life.
Reminiscing the whole life of mine. Sometimes I wish I could go back to the early days of my life and
live again, maybe the same life or may be in a different path. Sometimes I just feel like sitting alone
and appreciate that how beautifully this world has been created from oblivion.
Life is a journey and we are the travellers. A traveller finds the joy in beauty of every inch of the
world if he is a keen observer. I believe, I am of that species. I travel, I enjoy, and I perceive. My life is
my journey. I desire to accomplish the journey enjoying every moment.
