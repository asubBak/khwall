        <p class="article-writing"> The butterfly effect. They say a single dandelion might prevent catastrophic floods. The butterfly
effect. One significant action, one fleeting thought-either can reshape the course of history.
Consider a dot.
A dot misplaced can transform you into a wealthy man or, well, remain nothing more than a
meaningless speck.
This is the tale of an unremarkable boy and a dot.
A simple crimson dot that ignited a civil war.
Ali Ariyan was an unremarkable fifteen-year-old boy.
If anyone attempted to chronicle his life, it would be laughably brief: perhaps a few sentences
devoted to his unremarkable days as a cricket fielder for the neighbourhood team.
But Ariyan&#39;s existence isn&#39;t nearly as mundane as appearances suggest. His life divides into two
distinct epochs: the period he played mediocre cricket and the era he became the symbol of national
upheaval.
All triggered by a dot.
A single vivid crimson circle of bargain paint he chose to leave on a stone duelling.
Everything began during a bus journey to a hill station in the North - a school excursion he&#39;d spent all
summer saving for. His excitement evaporated when they were abandoned roadside after the bus
wheezed its final breath before surrendering to the scorching heat wave.
Ariyan surveyed his environment: several stone dwellings and a deteriorating shop nearby. He
approached the shop for water. A pot-bellied shopkeeper sat behind the grimy counter and handed
over a paint brush plus a dusty palette of crimson paints instead of proper change.
Glowering at the shopkeeper for this unfair exchange, Ariyan balanced the brush a top the palette
and moved back towards his group. The bus engine still refused to cooperate. Bored and friendless,
Ariyan returned to observing the surrounding
He wandered toward one stone structure. His gaze dropped to his paint palette. The wall behind him
appeared willingly to serve as canvas, so he began working, meticulously mixing the remaining water
droplets into the most vibrant crimson shade - a deep blood like hue. Eventually, a bright crimson
dot marked on the surface. The watery pigment trickled down to Ariyan&#39;s wrists as he reached for
the bottle again.
&quot;Need more dots for balloon bouquets. Maybe a down gripping the strings?&quot;
Before completing his first balloon, his PT teacher&#39;s whistle shrieked through the atmosphere,
startling him. He abandoned his art supplies and sprinted toward the bus The revived vehicle
travelled deeper into the mountains, away from the heat.
Around maghrib prayer time, Lotif Shah concluded he possessed the most wretched luck in the
entire north: an enormous ugly crimson dot defaced the the left side of his entrance.

The dot was his breaking point. Nobody disrespected Lotif Shah. He summoned his sons. Three
enormous men materialized at the fireplace and inquired what troubled his mind this time.
Lotif Shah thrust his hands skyward in theatrical fury and described the threatening circle on his wall.
He contemplated the anonymous offender who&#39;d vandalized his wall
see now, Lotif Shati&#39;s sons maintained reputations as local thugs, the bullies, the feared. They
cherished nothing beyond their beloved father the three sons unleased Chaos across a ten mile
radius. The local artist&#39;s residence was demolished; his paints were spilled. and children were
assembled and interrogated.
The pot-bellied shopkeeper. Rahmat, decided to check on the sons and inquire about the
disturbance. He crept up behind the three brothers as they continued interrogation. He cleared his
throat and tapped one of their shoulders.
&#39;What do you want, old man?&#39; huffed the tallest brother. The shopkeeper began complaining about
their commotion. Said it frightened away tourists. The brothers continued harassing students.
The shopkeeper rambled endlessly about sluggish business and how his most recent victim was a
short uniformed boy. He smiled smugly recalling how he&#39;d pocketed a full twenty by giving the boy
ancient Paint.
The brothers froze upon hearing the word paint. What variety of paints?&#39; bellowed the shortest
brother as he approached the shopkeeper menacingly.
&#39;Old crimsone one?&#39; stammered Rahmat in confusion. Suddenly, his vision was blocked by three
mountainous figures.
&#39;Wh-Why?&#39; he asked, shrinking toward his shop. Planning to paint your ancient shed, old boy?
Ignoring his question, the hairless middle brother growled. Where. Is. The Schoolboy?&#39; Sensing he&#39;d
Spoken incorrectly but suddenly feeling courageous, Rahmat crossed his arms and maintained this
position, refusing intimidation by the worthless brutes. Finding nothing but a lanky tourist standing
beside the shop, he realized words would be his sole defence. Before the shopkeeper could lecture
the brutes, an impatient brother, grabbed him by the throat. The shopkeeper backed away just in
time and hurled his slipper at the nearest brother.
It struck him in the chest but inflicted minimal damage. The tallest brother delivered an upper cut
before the shopkeeper could hurt another slipper.
The pot-bellied man collapsed backwords and moaned in agony. Before catching his breath, all three
brothers seized him by his kurta and gripped his neck. The shopkeeper&#39;s vision blurred; crimson and
white dots danced before his eyes. The final thing he remembered before losing consciousness was a
horrified American with a camera draped around his neck observing them from his shop&#39;s shade.
High Turner had never witnessed a street brawl. He clutched his camera watching the small man
flying in every direction before being choked by three men built like the mountains. He caught
fragments of conversation amid the fighting. Crimsor paint.
Schoolboy.
He stared in mortified fascination before realizing the small man had stopped resisting. Unfazed by
the lanky American approaching, the brothers continued choking the shopkeeper until he went limp.

Rahmat never sold another re-priced crimson paint palette again.
Hugh Turner froze in horror realizing he&#39;d just witnessed a murder. Trembling violently. he searched
for the guide&#39;s number and pressed call. He Flashed his camera lens at the dot. It appeared so
misplaced-so foolish-something with which he related somewhat excessively.
Minutes later, several events unfolded. An ambulance arrived to transport the shopkeeper. Police
surrounded the vicinity.
By 5pm the following day. Hugh Turner boarded his New York-bound plane while telephoning the
Huffington Post about his near death-experience in Pakistan&#39;s unruly north. His Twitter statement
already ranked among the Top-5 trending hashtags, and The New York Times was scheduling his
interview.
Over subsequent weeks, news outlets searched for the small boy who dared create art in South
Asia&#39;s conservative wasteland. Letter after letter circulated with his descriptions throughout
Pakistan, while the crimson dot photograph went viral. Journalists Flew into pakistan attempting to
access the crimson dotted dwelling. The entire nation erupted in frenzy searching for the boy who
painted the crimson dot: the artistic revolution&#39;s face.
The same evening, Lotif Shah spoke with his sons and later his friends. He refused to allow a menace
like this southern school boy to escape unpunished for the chaos he&#39;d created in his town.
Word (from Lotif Shah&#39;s living room naturally) circulated that the shopkeeper lost his life due to
poisonous money the southern child had given him. Devastated b_{4} their loss, locals felt betrayed
b_{4} the country-men and demanded vengeance. Procession&#39;s with Flags bearing Lotif Shah&#39;s face
inundated the north as the vengeance movement&#39;s symbols. New outlets became polarized between
the child being hero or villain while the world held its breath discovering his actual identity.
Ariyan glanced at his school&#39;s message announcing emergency lockdown: they were dismissed until
Further notice given recent riots from the north that had spilled southward.
His father summoned him to the adjacent room to yell at him while surfing through. While scading
his son. an image flickered on the 9 o&#39;clock news. It was his son. It was Ariyan with a crimson blot on
his left cheek, on a banner hoisted by hundreds of protesters.
&#39;What did you do, you worthless trash?&#39;, raising his hand Suddenly, the front door shattered and
their house flooded with protesters. They separated him from his father and hoisted him onto their
shoulders.
Ariyan froze as they departed the house: hundreds of people cheered his name, the revolution&#39;s face
and Pakistan&#39;s future. He was taken in by the local mayor, who provided special security because he
possessed intelligence about northerners leaving to seek revenge.
The south was prepared to spill blood, bright, warm, for its people. The north swore no rest until
obtaining the boy. The government issued orders for a border between north and south to maintain
peace.
Months dragged on as the nation was torn into sides, the wind turning frigid and the scent of fresh
blood almost detectable.
Ariyan enjoyed approximately one week of being a national revolutionary before growing weary of
it. He was sick of stamping stamping crimson dots onto people&#39;s left cheeks at press conferences.

Some cities hailed him as a hero while others persued his head as they burned dummies pasted with
posters of his face.
When can I play cricket again?
The truth was he was exhausted, and he was Frightened. Ali Aryan wanted to go home. He simply
wanted to be a boy again.
Suddenly, he heard shouting. He listened intently. It was children. Kids his age. Playing. Playing
cricket.
He basked in the scene: boys and girls his age, playing in a makeshift field, old, battered guns as bals
and empty grenades as balls. He waved at them. They froze looking at him, but a second later waved
back and invited him over.
Ariyan looked around for guards and, finding the coast clear, ran toward the group. He took his
position as a fielder, adjacent to an abandoned Shopping centre.
They spent the afternoon playing. Nobody noticed the sun dip below the horizon. Nobody noticed a
lonely boy on the shopping centre&#39;s second Floor. flat on the ground, elfish features scrunched in
concentration as he pointed the gun&#39;s nozzle toward Ariyan
Certainly, nobody noticed the laser dot shining on Ariyan&#39;s nape. A small dot. Blood crimson in the
Shade.
