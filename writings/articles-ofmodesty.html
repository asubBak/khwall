        <p class="article-writing"> Modesty is defined as one of the virtues which reflects one&#39;s good conduct in aspect of one&#39;s attire
behaviour and outlook. The very noun &quot;Modesty&#39; also refers to one&#39;s moderate and humble view of
his own abilities, achievements and after all, character. Nowadays modesty has been so rare product
which is either extravagant or out of stock. It may be a strange note that modesty is a product now.
For the sake of keeping pace with new era, people has devised the virtues as products. In fact,
products have market value if those are in limited stock or few can afford them. But above all, it is
thought to be a good quality of a human being
Many men, many minds. Mind never stops working. Approximately 82 to 8.3 billion minds may have
individual and different perspective. That&#39;s why, the absolute defination of modesty cannot exist.
Another issue comes, the standard of modesty can not be set for the man to follow. It is an urgent
demand that the standard definition of modesty should be entitled. Modesty is a vast
comprehensive virtue adorned with types and salient aspects. Sometimes, surface Observation
misinterprets the genuine explanation. Common people nurture traditional prejudices years after
years. They are captivated within the four walks of their legacy-legacy of prevailing social norms.
Common people firmly cling to the belief that progressive people cannot be modest. Modesty purely
lies in conservative thoughts. Religious vision can be there. Many good features of modesty are
visible and impressive
Modest people show respect to others by greetings. talk less, occupied with own commitments and
may be family oriented people.
But modesty does care about more than that. Does modesty make a good fence around a person?
Modest people are generally thought to be polite and calm in nature. They have command over their
attitude. The ideas are appreciating
Modesty must have limit also. People can go insane when they are to think about the limit of
modesty.
Modesty is observed well when modest people are not involved in chaos. violation and unrest
circumstances. But can life go in the same way always?
In crisis, modesty can be an obstackle. This obstacle can create inconvenient situation in every
institution-Family, society, country and finally the world.
Modest people can veil their bodies with more than enough garments, control their conduct for
harmony. But they must not be unaware of their sensibility. They should not cover their eyes, ears or
minds with drapes.
Modesty lies in the midst of conservative as well as progressive thoughts. Modesty should be a voice
against in a justified way. Modest people are not conservative at all. Genuinely modest people go for
a reason first, then decide to work on it. Modesty defines a man&#39;s character which leads him to be a
part of any institution-Family, society, country or the world. An intelligent cannot deny and should
try to be perfectly modest.
