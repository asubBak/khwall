        <p class="article-writing"> It is a far far better thing than I do than I have ever done: It is a far far better rest that I go to than I
have ever known.&quot; - That was the very last lines of the heroic Sydney Carton before his head got
chopped off in the huge guillotine and the women in the crowd count. &quot;No. 24!&quot;
Charles Dickens&#39; &#39;A Tale of Two Cities&#39; is a historical yet fictional novel. It is set during one of the
most iconic periods of the history, The French Revolution.
The redemption of The French and struggle of the innocent aristrocrates are depicted well in the
novel
The story goes on with the chaos of the Revolutionary France and its neighbouring London. Learning
the History in an entertaining way was a great experience. The book demonstrates the epoch in a
different perspective. The book also comes with a lot of lessons that can be plotted in our real lives.
We can have a clear idea on revolutiones. Descendents of the former Aristrocracy. Charles Darney in
the novel, faces extreme torture and vengeful barbarity from the raged citizens for all the inhumane
acts done by his ancestors.
&quot;It was the best of times, il was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of
foolishment, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of light, it
was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope. it was the winter of despair. &quot;- The lines of
Charles Dickens describes the period greatly. The unique style of story telling and numerous twists in
the story make the audience attached to the story making it the 2nd most read and sold novel of all
time.
Finally, a book is always incomplete with the absence of emotion and love. The story of Lawyer
Sydney Carton and Aristrocrate Charles Darney grabs a few drops of tear of readers. The sacrifices
and the ending of the book make it on the top of my favourite books. I suggest the book as a must
for someone who is trying to have a taste of the English literature or just trying to have a productive
leisure.
Next time, when your loved ones ask you about the sacrifices he or she made for you, just give them
a smile and say.
&quot;Heh! Can&#39;t Beat Sydney Carton!&quot;
