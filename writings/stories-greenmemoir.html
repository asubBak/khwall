        <p class="article-writing"> It has been 30 years….. Yet it seems so new.

Back then, a young man brought me into a vast field. I could see the endless sky. The sun shone as brightly as a golden crown. Tiny flowers looked so happy standing on the green meadows. Whenever I looked around, I could either see colourful flowers or giant green trees. Young kids were running, playing and smiling. Housewives made their way to the pond with earthen jars in their arms. Peasants were working hard but happily. Their faces were dipped in sweat, yet sparkling under the sun.

I was kept beside the border of the field. The man had 2 sons, a daughter, and a plot full of crops. All the boys used to go outside, play, and have fun. Although the girl remainder still within the shaky bamboo fences. At noon, when everything would go silent, I could see her sitting in the yard. Her eyes would be on the endless nature, filled with the to feel it, to roam around it. But it never happened.

Later, one day, she did come outside. She was in a scarlet dress, adorned with ornaments. I believed her dream was coming true. But her face never agreed. Her eyes were filled with anxiety. Why was she sad? Why did she not smile? 

At that time, I couldn’t realise. In fact, she was just changing her place, from cage to another. Her new owner bought her at a good price from the parents.

I could never know further about the young lady, but the parents lived happily. However, Happiness can not stay long.

Time continued to flow.
 One day, a man appeared in lavish attire with 4 soldiers beside him. His lustful gaze fell upon the vast field, the golden crops, and my green friends. The man stood before the door and knocked.

The peasant probably though of a guest, but in no time, he was grounded by the soldiers. Panic and fear seized him and his wife. They begged the rich man to let them go. But, alas! He was poor. In the false excuse of not paying tax, they were forcefully driven out of their house.

From that day, I started to forget happiness. The little nest of the peasants was shattered into pieces. Some hangmen came, holding saws, and I lost my friends one after another. Are building stood up. Factories were established. Offices were built. Bigger houses were made. Yet, I somehow managed to escape. (Luckily or not). I found myself submerged in solitude.

Now, nothing seems happy. Nothing seems green. Kids do not play in the field now. Housewives do not go to the pond. Peasants do not shine with sweat. Flowers never bloom in the meadows.

30 years back… Quite far, yet so close to my heart. A deep ambition of my soul. 

Will I ever get those days back? Will the sun ever shine bright again? Will it ever be so green.
