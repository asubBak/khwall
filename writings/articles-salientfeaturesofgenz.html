        <p class="article-writing"> Gen-Z is the short form of Generation-Z. The people who are born in 1997-2021 are called Gen-Z and
their age is about 12-27 years. The another name of Generation-Z is “Zoomers”. This indicated the
forefather of Gen-Z, we should understand their quality and leadership. At first in 2024 in
Bangladesh an uprising was held by Gen-Z. That uprising started from June and finished at
August(2024). Firstly the movement was to reform the Quota. But day by day it turned into a mass
uprising. On June 5, 2024 High court declared the freedom fighters quota is not lawful to be
cancelled in Government job. On 1 st July, a student’s committee against injustice was formed. Also,
there was a mission named “Bangla blockade” occurred on 6 July. On 16 July, the first martyr of that
movement. Abu Sayed, from Begum Rokaya University. Rangpur was killed by police. After those, by
the leadership of Judge Obaidul Hasan 7 members of a judgement committees declared that there
will be 93% merit and 7% quota in the government job. But Gen-Z students wanted the revenge of
the martyr student, died in the movement. Then, they started &#39;March for justice&#39; , &#39;Remembering the
heroes&#39; and &#39;Long March to Dhaka&#39; , these types of movements. At last, On 5 August 2024 finally the
fascist government resigned and escaped from Bangladesh. In the leading of the quota movement,
there were 15 students of Dhaka University. After the resignation of the past government, a
temporary government was created and the main advisor of this Government was Dr. Muhammad
Yunus. Also there were 24 advisors of that Government. On the other hand, in Nepal, normal Gen-Z
citizens made a uprising in the aim of resigning the government of Nepal. The reasons were financial
problems, injustice to the middle class people, electricity problem etc. While the movement was
going on, the government closed the social media and internet just like Bangladesh. So, the students
got more angry and continued the movement The main reason behind the movement was &#39;The
Theory of Nepo Kids&#39;. It is a word of Hollywood taken from &#39;Nepo Baby&#39;. This word means to do
injustice to the lower class people. The Upper class citizens of Nepal took advantages of being rich
Against this, the Gen-Z used a hashtag ‘Politicians Nepo Babies’. Nepal On 9 September, 2015, finally
the prime minister of Nepal &quot;K.P Sharma Oli&quot; resigned. The Gen-Z of Nepal got inspiration from
Bangladesh and won the movement. By the above incidents, we must understand the generation
gap between the past and present Generation- Z or Zoomers are really qualified generation to lead
the upcoming modern world by their judicious mind and quality of leadership.
