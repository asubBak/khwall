        <p class="article-writing"> The sky was gloomy, full of clouds. The distant roaring clouds sounded like war-cries. And just like a
current of a river, the breeze seemed to be non-stop, eternal. timeless. Finally, small drops of rain
started falling on the ground, pulling down a curtain of mist. Suddenly. the world seemed to be so
unreal that it felt like a mysterious and magical place where fairy tales come true and reality can not
interfere. My eyes shimmered with hopes. But soon the shimmer faded away when I looked at the
empty seat beside me. The cold wind flow hit me with reality blowing out the candle inside my mind.
I felt as if a vital piece of my soul had drifted away. leaving me incomplete.
&quot;You promised that you would never leave me.&quot; My eyes stung with tears I closed my eyes and
sighed. a sigh of frustration and hopelessness. &quot;But will you really?&quot; My heart twisted in pain.
Sometimes. all you can do is to let the pain sink inside you. so I did soon. I opened my eyes and
looked around. This place was obviously familiar. But except that, everything was different that day.
(Years back...)
The spring morning was full of radiant sunlight. Everything seemed to be made of gold. The growing
leaves, chirping and hopping of birds as well as the zephyr made the whole environment
mesmerizing. And obviously, she was sitting beside me, glaring &quot;So, all of these were your plan? The
sudden visit, taking me to this park and all these.&quot; she eyed the cake and the flower bouquette. &quot;Yes
indeed.&quot; I smiled knowing that she was just pretending to be angry. She crossed her arms. &quot;So, how
could you convince your &#39;Dear Sir&#39; for this leave?&quot; &quot;You know what. I have that charishma to
convince anyone properly.&quot; I winked. This time, she could not hold back her joy anymore. She threw
her arms around me and became the Same playful, whimsical and energetic girl with whom I fell in
love. &quot;Thanks for everything.&quot; She whispered. &quot;Anything for you. Then we heard the sound of
laughing. Her friends were watching us from a distance she gave me a defeated smile. She stood up
with a jump and gave me a Folded paper. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare to unfold it before you get back to your
place. &quot;She winked. Then she smiled a brilliant and heart-crumpling smile which made her look
ethreal, just like an angel. Then she ran towards her friends. I smiled at the paper and put it in my
pocket. I looked around. Then something caught my eyes in the sky. It was coming towards this
direction.&quot; Is that a Falcon or an eagle?&quot; I questioned myself. Il was coming towards this direction.
Suddenly. I heard a scream.&quot; Everyone get out of the park! Just get out of here!&quot; Then a distant
explosion declared to me that what it really was. The explosion was as if the whole world trembled
with a scream. The whole park broke into a chaos. A sudden panic prickled through-Out my whole
body. I stood up and looked around but she was nowhere to be found. Panic grew more and I
started running here and there, screaming her name helplessly. Suddenly something exploded
beside me, throwing me off the ground. The world became blurry but I tried to scream her name but
nothing came out of my mouth. The world slowly started to fade away into oblivion.
When I opened my eyes. I found myself in a hospital. The whole right side of my body was screaming
in pain. I looked around and saw few of her friends beside my bed. &quot;Where is she? Is she okay?&quot; I
asked. They looked at each other but said nothing.&quot; This isn&#39;t funny. Where is she?&quot; I was dead
serious. Finally one spoke &quot;We couldn&#39;t find her.&quot; &quot;Stop lying to me! Where did she go?&quot; My voice
rising in panic. They remained silent. A sudden numbness hollowed me from within.
&quot;Please you have to go back and look again, she was just there&quot; I pleaded in a broken voice. I
slumped back to my bed. Then I remembered that what she gave me. I pulled out the paper and
unfolded it. But I never thought that it would torment me for the rest of the eternity.

My love.
I&#39;m so puzzled! Not sure which address will be perfect for you. But every nano second. I feel your
presence in my life. Thanks&#39; the word will not be enough to define your loftiness. I can love you more
than I can say. What we share is it just love, it&#39;s a complicated knot which has tied two souls too
tight.
And always remember that even if the world falls apart I will never let go of your hands.
Awaiting soul for you...
(Present...)
Rain stopped. Clouds stopped roaring but I. I stayed still like a stone, silent like the space. A drop of
tear managed to escape my eyes. This kind of promises were never meant to be broken. I thought. I
wiped out the drop of tear and folded the paper. &quot;That&#39;s why I am still hoping... still waiting for your
return.&quot;
