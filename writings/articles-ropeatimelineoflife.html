        <p class="article-writing"> When the green leaves fall apart from the trees.
Swinging with the rhythm of the wind and falling with harmony, no one knows which side of leaf will
end up touching the ground or will it touch the ground? Who know? Often many leaves are burnt in
the war field and many are dead even before getting apart from the tree. I often wondered, the life
of this simple leaf is so uncertain, filled with mystery and thrill. And what about us, what about our
life? This is a story of our life, where every seconds create millions more possibilities for the next
second. So, &quot;life&quot; starts with birth, not in a scientific biological way but in a plain view.
And birth sets fire on a &quot;rope&quot;. Flow of this flame. is what I call flow of life. Life has one dimension,
again not in a mathematical three dimensional compared to the thoughts and imaginations about
just next one year. That&#39;s why I say, &quot;Past Flies as it fades, but the future remains.&quot; But something is
still missing. &quot;The present. There is nothing called present. Ongoing burning part of the rope reflects
the present. Expected results do not come always. Some parts burns faster. where as some very
slowly. But there is chance to mould it again. Few drops of oil in the fire for accelaration of burning
can be the few drops of motivation of our life which can boost our will power.
Some magical drops of rain that can drive away the flame and the whole circumstance is the love of
our life. Today&#39;s story is at the verge of completion. But yours is not. When fire comes to the very
end part of the rope and burns the last few parts into ashes, our story ends completely. What is the
next to the end? The rope extinct view, but in a realistic approach. That dimension is &quot;time&quot; May be
that&#39;s why I call our life is like a burning rope. Is it the ending story of mine? May be not for today.
Our life is filled with so much elements, will it gonna end with this few lines? Every moment, the
rope is burning, some parts are becoming ashes. The ashes forms our past, one of the elements of
our time dimension. Magic is happening in this dimension. Think about the life from beginning to
end atleast in a relaxed way. Memories will not haunt you anymore. It&#39;s the time when magic comes
to play. Burnt rope creates ashes and ashes can be compared to the little past of ours. But what
about the future? The amount of rope yet to burn represents the future. It is very long in length but
not For everyone. Actually future holds many possibilities and probabilities. For instance my
thoughts about the past 20 years is nothing From existence? Most of the ashes mixes and flies with
the wind of the oblivion and few remains. For those few ashes, we are remembered even after
death. Do you want a reality check? Like the uncertainty of the leaf, the lernight of your life rope is
uncertain. While you are at the ending part of the writing, a lot has been already burnt From your
rope. Who knows, how much is there, yet to burn!
