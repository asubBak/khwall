        <p class="article-writing"> For how long people can stay silent against injustice before the very silence becomes a spark? Born
in the hearts of people filled with grudges and wounds, The French Revolution was that very spark.
For centuries The French royalties and Aristrocrats reigned over the third estate making them suffer
endlessly while they lived in luxury. But in 1793 the lower class people stood against them all to
claim their freedom and dignity. But what they hoped to achieve, became their biggest nightmare.
The call for liberty and equality faded into silence until the thought became a night mare itself.
Paris 1793
The smell of blood and fear filled the air. In the middle of the city stood the guillotine, tall and silent,
waiting for the next victim. Everyday people labelled as enemy of the revolution were brought there
to punish.
24 years Elodie Marceau born in a family where her father was a day labourer. She diligently fought
in the revolution but now is being accused as the traitor. Elodie held on the red ribbon given by her
brothers Julien before he went to the revolution as the last string of hope. She stood at the edge of
the crowd looking at the guillotine. Her face turned into utter disbelief when she saw her old teacher
who had once been kind to her. Being brought to the guillotine, she couldn’t bear to watch her being
stuck down without mercy. She turned away and started running into an alleyway until she arrived
inside an old bakery. Her heart was beating fast. After calming herself down, she saw a group of
people sitting around a candle. scared and hungry. What she saw later on rekindled her light of
hope. Julien started next to the group. Their eyes met and Elodie took no time to run and hug him.
&quot;Julier! I thought... I thought you were dead!&quot; Elodie said as she sobbed.
Julien also couldn&#39;t hold his tears and hugged her back. &quot;Not yet, &quot;he said with a weak smile.
&quot;We are leaving Paris tonight,&quot; Julien said, &quot;Across the Scine river. Then northwest, to Britain.&quot;
Clinging to the last remaining hope, Elodie agreed.
That night the moon dazzled. Elodie and Julien moved quietly on the night streets, and then the rain
fell suddenly, swallowing the silence around them as they reached the Pont De La concorde Bridge,
making the stone platform wet. But they had no choice. Julien steeped out first and Elodie followed.
After half across someone shouted from the back, &quot;Arietez! (stop)&quot;
Julien pulled his pistol out and started to shoot at them while running holding Elodie&#39;s wrist.
Suddenly a bullet struck, and he hit the ground.
&quot;Julien!&quot;. Eddie screamed, tried to lift him but his body refused. She fell beside him, her hands
trembling and his finger tighten.
&quot;Run... and survive, someone has to keep believing.&quot; These were the last words she heard from him.
She sat there quietly, her mind completely blank.
Few days passed, and she was being confined in a prison cell. How lifeless her eyes were! A guard
shouted, &quot;Bring her over!&quot; &quot;She didn’t fight, nor cry but let the fate embrace her. The fate received
when others labelled them as the Enemy of the Revolution.
