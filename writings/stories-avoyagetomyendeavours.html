        <p class="article-writing"> &#39;Today, you are well acquainted with a prominent figure. Nadir Hamza. You wait days after days to
be enlisted in his fanbase. He is celebrated as an icon amongst the youngsters. Now I cordially
request, our honourable guest Nadir Hamza to come over the stage. Please. give a big hand for Nadir
Hamza, the anchor was at loud.
I could not burst into happy tears or electrifying shouts. With pride, I adorned the podium.
About three hundred fifty eyes stared at me altogether. I started uttering and could remember. my
legs were no more shaky.
But those very legs once and again betrayed me when I was only a boy of thirteen. I was not a gold
spoon fed boy but I was dedicated to prove my worth. As I was the eldest son of my parents, they
consciously or subconsciously thought that I would make our family solvent with a magic wand I was
a boy of timid nature In college. I had countless chances to be a recognized personality among the
fellow mates. But I was not enough confident, courageous and above all outspoken. My mentors,
the promising teachers had been a shade above my head. Till now even death, I will recall two
teachers in my lifetime. But they are entitled in my diary in different ways. But now, each moments
send me to those Flashback.
Mr. Intekhab, a smart, prudent, dashing man, did not take pressure to provide knowledge. He never
compromised with anything out of the prescribed rules. He was not a classroom traditional teacher,
he was a mentor, guide, motivator. He never allowed me to be extracted from the list of the
speakers in the classroom public speaking session. Sometimes, I, the most polite boy, tried to give
him a bluff.
Day by day, even I could not tolerate his remarkable attention on me.
Memories are inscribed but that memory is inscribed in too deep.
It was 8:30 am. The loudest bell I heard. &quot;Oh! I should skip my turn anyway. I cannot be insulted
more! I have self esteem at least.&quot;
Mr. Intekhab Morshed greeted with bold vocal, &#39;Good morning, boys.&#39; He announced. &quot;Today I will
go for a lottery and the first person will adorn the lecture for 10 minutes.
A little hope peeped. I started praying to the Almighty. &quot;Please, save me. Save me for once, I will
donate hundred taka to the poor people, &#39;But the Almighty was not beside the dodger till the last.
Undoubtedly, there was my name in that picked paper.
Mr. Intekhab smiled and I could see his twinkling eyes. I approached to the lecture but I felt only
trembling. My legs were so shaky that I could not breath well. Topic was, The person you will
remember most.&#39;
I could not utter a single word for first three minutes. After three minutes, Mr. Intekhab&#39;s vocal
Tsunami ruined my last hope. The limitless insult I could not bear. With the blessings of my weakest
English, I started my speech. I talked about Mr. Intekhab whom I would remember for working
behind my progress. Suddenly. Mr. Intekhab interrupted me and he requested all to applause. I got
frightened that surely he was agitated. But he was not at all. With contempt, Mr. Intekhab told me.
Be bored by me always. I know, you will take the responsibility. Advanced wishes for the great
speaker.&quot;

Being bored with his sense of responsibility. I took that toughest responsibility on my shoulder. That
man led me to the path of new journey and I travelled.
Another one. I can not keep him away from my gratitude list. He is none other than my father. The
person always believed that I had the capability to achieve if I had efforts. He could not be aware of
my study. And finally I tried and chosen a great way to be felt, thought. discussed and honoured.
Nelson Mandela was my icon growing up. One of his quotes goes like this, &quot;It seems impossible until
it is done.&quot;
Now when I look back. I have made possible the impossible one being an influencial public speaker.
Another one of his saying which I can relate to is, &quot;A good head and a good heart are always a
Formidable combination.&quot;
I realize now, joint venture of those two persons, a good headed teacher and a good hearted father
successfully made me - a formidable combination.
I will never cease to remember them.
