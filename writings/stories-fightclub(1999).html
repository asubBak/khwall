        <pre class="article-writing"> I was having a casual gossiping with my friends while returning from school. It was a great day for all
of us overall - as we had extra games period and ICT lab class. We were very energetic as we had just
finished our half yearly examination. The weather was somehow colder than usual and one of my
friends. Sajid, spoke up.&quot; Man! This day is perfect for watching F1, the movie. Got the new
headphones recently.&quot; &quot;Yeah! Movies will be dropping from the sky this month. I can&#39;t help being
excited.&quot;
They went on talking about movies and directors and I was left alone beside them as I was never a
movie monger rather a boy who was favour in games and sports. I got separated on the way when
we reached our home, the first one.
At night after the dinner. I sat in front of my desktop. I felt like missing something valuable in life. So
I searched Mozilla Firefox, &quot;The best movie of all genres in all eras in the human history.&quot;
The engine suggested me few movies, but a poster where a man was trying to squeeze a soap with
his hands caught my attention. The name was &#39;Fight Club&#39;. The movie was of about 3 hours made in
1999. I said to myself, &quot;Let&#39;s invest 3 hours of my life to this movie. Maybe something productive...&quot;
Fight Club is one of those rare movies that makes you question why it hurts you so much even
though you are not the person getting punched.
David Fincher directs the movie master fully exploring the themes of the dark side of the capitalistic
world. It is based on a novel of an American novelist. Chuch Palahniuk. The story of an anonymous
narrator who constantly suffers from insomnia is told in the movie. Edward Norton did his job
perfectly playing the character. He looks for his treatment but the world itself was behind the
curtain. How the world is so cruel and dirty to some people! The narrator faces the rebellious Tyler
Durden, a careless soap salesman who wants to change the capitalistic world. The creation of an
underground fight club occurs where people fight not for winning but for fighting. The primary
formation of the fight club turns into a chaotic and destructive movement known as&#39; Project
Mayhem.&quot;
The movie never fails to entertain people. It stands as a direct confrontation against the dark reality
of the capitalistic world and the societal pressure a man faces. This movie depicts how a man can
lose his own identity due to this selfish society. Except the movie description. I would not be able to
understand that it was released 26 years ago. The music and editing are better than most of the
movies of 20s and also ethreal.
The deadly and violent fights among men make the movie so special. The character of Marla Singer
also adds a soft emotion to the chaos. At last, the twist of the story is the best one you&#39;ll ever see.
Though it has been a long time. but the dark truth of the capitalistic world it explored-prevents it
from the extinction.
Fight Club, a movie of blood and punches, is a question towards humanity- towards you. The
answers are not easy and that makes it one of the most prominent movies of its era.
Next day I went to school. There, Sajid asked me.&quot; me. &quot;What did you do last night? Didn&#39;t see you in
FIFA!&quot;
&quot;I watched a movie, it was best.&quot;
